# QVADRANS-SimpleFOC-Controller
Code for the QVADRANS V1 SimpleFOC motor control board with platformio &amp; arduino Board &amp; variant files 

The board & variant files were based on the files for the STM32 B-G431B-ESC1 motor control board, the datasheet for the STM32G431CBU6, and the QVADRANS v1 schematic. So far they have only been tested with a simple blink sketch.
