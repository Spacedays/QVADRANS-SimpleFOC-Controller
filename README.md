# QVADRANS-SimpleFOC-Controller
Starter code for the [QVADRANS V1](https://oshwlab.com/cost.co/20230516_lepton_pro_g431) SimpleFOC motor control board by [Valentine](https://github.com/vtpgit) with platformio &amp; arduino.

So far UART and I2C are confirmed working, with motor control and CAN bus testing planned for the near future. SPI and inline current sense functionality should also be possible with this board and are planned for eventual inclusion.

More information on the QVADRANS V1 board can be found on [the board's SimpleFOC Community topic](https://community.simplefoc.com/t/qvadrans-v1-0-fka-lepton-3-0/3376).
